Thank you for playing Andy's Super Great Park. Here are some
information you may find interesting.

== System requirements ==

The game requires 80 Mo of free space on the hard disc to be
installed.

Running the game requires a hardware accelerated graphics card
supporting OpenGL 2.1, with at least 128 Mo of memory. The game
will consume something like 70 Mo of the main system memory and should
run well with a processor at 2 GHz.

The game runs with a resolution of 1280x720. You will need a mouse to
play, the keyboard is optional.

== Configuration ==

The in game menus allow to turn the full screen mode on or off, and to
mute or unmute the sounds and the music. Theses settings are stored in

  \Documents and Settings\<username>\.super_great_park\config

The volume of the sounds and the music can be set in this file but not
in the menus.

Alternatively, you can force the full screen (or windowed) mode by
passing the argument --fullscreen (respectively --windowed) to the
program:

  <Install dir>\bin\super-great-park.exe --fullscreen

The screen resolution can be forced with the --screen-width and
--screen-height arguments:

  <Install dir>\bin\super-great-park.exe --screen-width=1024 --screen-height=600
 
== How to Play ==

Use the mouse to move the cursor. A left click shoots a plunger, a right
click shoots a cannonball. Move the mouse wheel upward or downward to
jump or speed up. Alternatively, you can jump by pressing the up arrow
or the shift key, and you can speed up by pressing the down arrow or
the control key.

The goal of the game is to grab enough balloons with the plungers. Use
the cannonballs to destroy what annoys you and to reach the high
scores by triggering chain explosions.

== Magic Keys ==

 - F2 shows the FPS,
 - F5 takes a screenshot (saved in
   \Documents and Settings\<username>\.super_great_park\),
 - F12 toggles the full screen mode on or off,
